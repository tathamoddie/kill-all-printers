# Kill All Printers

We all hate paper. We understand smarter ways to do our jobs. Our users aren't so lucky.

This repo is a collection of handy and occasionally witty ways for helping to ween your online users off their printing habit.

## What is it?

A collection of CSS files which replace or annotate the content in your document, some more smarmy then others.

`wake-up-call.css` is probably the least objectionable of the replacements, getting the point across without being rude. Thus, no fun at all ;)

## Annotations

* `going-backwards.css` tells the user they're going back in time, so their text has been made backwards, too!

##Replacements

* `hide-all-content` Replaces the page with, well... nothing.
* `mean-skull` Replaces the content with a skull and crossbones, who DOES NOT APPROVE.
* `out-of-paper` Replaces all content with a message telling the user... y'know.
* `pc-load-letter` What the F#&K does THAT mean?
* `wake-up-call` Replaces the content with compliance text indicating that the page is out of date because you printed it, it's the turing-damned future, and giving the source URL.

## How to Use

1. Include the relevant css into your product's pages.
2. There is no 2.

(*Optional*: Give users a flag to turn it off if they REALLY have to print something.  But put the guilts on 'em first, and maybe suggest an alternative or two.)
