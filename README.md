# Kill All Printers
We all hate paper. We understand smarter ways to do our jobs. Our users aren't so lucky.

This repo is a collection of handy and occasionally witty ways for helping to ween your online users off their printing habit.


## What is it?
A collection of CSS files which replace or annotate the content in your document, some more smarmy then others.

wake-up-call.css is probably the least... objectionable of the replacements, getting the point across without being rude.  Thus, no fun at all ;)

##Annotations
* **going-backwards** Tells the user they're going back in time, so their text has been made backwards, too!
##Replacements

* **hide-all-content** Replaces the page with, well... nothing.
* **mean-skull** Replaces the content with a Skull and Crossbones, who DOES NOT APPROVE.
* **out-of-paper** Replaces all content with a message telling the user... y'know.
* **pc-load-letter** What the F#&K does THAT mean?
* **wake-up-call** Replaces the content with compliance text indicating that the page is out of date because you printed it, it's the turing-damned future, and giving the source URL.

##How to Use
1. Include the relevant css into your product's pages.
2.  There is no 2.

(*Optional*: Give users a flag to turn it off if they REALLY have to print something.  But put the guilts on 'em first, and maybe suggest an alternative or two.)
